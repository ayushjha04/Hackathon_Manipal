We live in times where the internet is growing more rapidly than ever: it doubles in size every 12 months, and by 2020 its space will occupy about 44 zettabytes. Consequently, online consumers are exposed to a variety of offerings and are faced with a great amount of options before making a desired purchase. This means that consumers have a lot of alternatives to consider, channels and media to decide which option is the best for them.

Translating these options into communication channels, one can make inference about the consumer’s path-to-purchase. A consumer purchase journey entails a part of a general customer experience which consists of distinct contacts (touchpoints) among the customer and the firm. Thus, the purchase journey can be defined as “the process a customer goes through, across all stages and touchpoints”.

Businesses can derive insights from the navigational path so as to understand and maybe predict the online consumer behavior. A touchpoint refers to “a customer contact point, or a medium through which the firm and the customer interact”. Various researchers have divided the touchpoints into two basic categories: The customer-initiated or customer-owned contacts (CIC) and the firm-initiated or brand-owned contacts (FIC).

A customer-initiated contact, by definition, is a contact that is initiated by a customer. This can be either a generic/ more specific search in a search engine machine, a type in the company’s website or an action made in an application. While a firm-initiated contact is any touch point that results from a company’s initiative and usually is also managed by it. Channels such as display, retargeting, affiliate and e-mail advertising have been classified as contacts initiated by the firm. It is interesting to identify which of the touchpoint types is more effective and can lead to more conversions among consumers.

One can make inference that the consumers are using multiple channels to evaluate alternatives, search information and make conversions. Thus, consumers’ interactions with the various channels, can lead to purchases from the company or make them buy from the competitors.

Consumers initiating contacts by themselves are expected to have more conversions in the firm’s website. However, the nature of consumer purchase journey involves more than CICs; customers are also coming across with firm-initiated contacts which can influence their purchase decisions.

Yet not all the consumers express the same preferences when navigating online; It is important to consider consumer heterogeneity across options and do not consider their behavior as a whole. Demographics and behavioral patterns differ among various segments and play a role throughout the path-to-purchase.

Therefore, the main research question of Datathon is:
How do different consumer segments behave when they come across various touchpoints?

In order to shed light to the main question, the following sub-questions are to be answered:

1.What is the effect of CICs on booking conversions?
2.Which are the consumer segments who engage in CICs and convert?
3.Can a firm-initiated contact make customers who have engaged in customer-initiated contacts with competitors, make them shift consideration?
4.Which segments are more likely to do so?
